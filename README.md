# wasm_feature_detect

This repository contains small JS code snippets that can be used to feature detect different WebAssembly subfeatures:
 - https://webassembly.org/roadmap/
 - https://github.com/WebAssembly/website/issues/214

This repository is similar to https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wasm-feature-detect, but intended to be easily embeddable to external code by easily copy-pasting the code (rather than needing to set up a npm ecosystem), and all the feature tests operate synchronously.
